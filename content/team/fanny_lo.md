My name is Fanny and I am the Co-President of Schulich Ignite. I work closely with my fellow Co-President to guide the executive team to ensure our club runs smoothly and achieves its goals. I am currently on a 16-month internship before I return back to school to complete my degree in Software engineering (with a minor in Biomedical engineering). A fun fact about me is that I am a fanatic on all things fountain pen and ink! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about Ignite, or if you just want to geek out about pens!
