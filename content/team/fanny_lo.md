Hi! My name is Fanny and I am the VP of content development. I am in charge of managing the content created for sessions and collaborations, and any relevant technologies used by Schulich Ignite. I am currently in my third year of software engineering with a minor in biomedical engineering. A fun fact about me is that I am a fanatic on all things fountain pen and ink! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about Ignite, or if you just want to geek out on pens!
