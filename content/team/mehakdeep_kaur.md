Hello! I’m Mehak and I am the VP Events at Schulich Ignite. I am responsible for organizing the end-of-semester gala to give our mentees a chance to present the projects they worked on. My role also includes organizing informative events with fellow clubs. I’m currently in my third year of software engineering. I like the 3D graphics side of programming! Outside of school, I love to paint and read anything fantasy and mystery (I absolutely love plot twists and Sherlock Holmes-esque detective stories!).
