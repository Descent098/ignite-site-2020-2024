Hi everyone! My name is Logan, I’m the VP of Content Development at Schulich Ignite. My job is to manage anything and everything that has to do with the material that our students learn from along with any technology Ignite uses (such as the website, the Point Tracker, the Discord bot, etc.)! I’m currently in my third year of software engineering and I’m super passionate about all things programming. In my free time, you might find me playing video games (Tears of the Kingdom is my current obsession), working on coding projects, or hiking/skiing in the mountains. I’m very excited to be part of such an amazing executive team!
