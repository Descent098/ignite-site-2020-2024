My name is Dimitar Janevski and I am the VP of Content Development at Ignite. I am responsible for overseeing the development of any tools our students use, as well as all the lecture content and exercises for our students. I am currently in my second year of Software Engineering. In my free time, I love to play and watch soccer, and watch movies!
