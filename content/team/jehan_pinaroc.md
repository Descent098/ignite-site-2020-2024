Hi! I'm Jehan, the VP of Communications for Schulich Ignite. I manage the club's social media accounts and work to grow our community by connecting with various groups across Canada and conducting outreach initiatives. I'm currently in my third year of Electrical Engineering. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, reading, and hiking.
