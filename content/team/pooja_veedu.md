Hello! My name is Pooja and I am the VP Communications for Schulich Ignite. I am responsible for managing the club’s media platforms, facilitating communication between mentors and mentees as well as conducting overall outreach initiatives to grow the club’s membership. I am also currently finishing my last year of a degree in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Digital Engineering. In my free time I like to read, play badminton and go rock climbing!
