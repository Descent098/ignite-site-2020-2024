Hello! My name is Ajay Arumugam and I am the VP Events of Schulich Ignite. I am responsible for brainstorming, planning and coordinating events, including our end of the season Ignite Gala. I am currently in my second year of Software Engineering with a minor in Entrepreneurship and Enterprise Development. In my free time, I love learning about personal finance and stock trading.
