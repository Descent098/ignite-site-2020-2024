Hello! I'm Jannine, your Co-President at Schulich Ignite. My primary role involves collaborating closely with my fellow Co-President and our dedicated executive team to guarantee the delivery of top-tier coding workshops and experiences.

I am a Software Engineering student currently undergoing a 16-month internship at Bentley Systems. I am set to return to my final year of studies next fall. In my free time I love working on coding projects, reading and knitting!
