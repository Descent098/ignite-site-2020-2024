Hello, I’m Michelle, and I’m the VP External for Schulich Ignite. I’m currently a second year BUCS (Business and Computer Science) major at UBC! I’m responsible for planning events such as the hackathons and game jams. Throughout my time at Schulich Ignite, I’m aiming to provide more opportunities via events to expand students’ coding knowledge. Beyond my degree, I’m interested in fitness, language learning (French + Italian!) and reading.
