Hello everyone! My name is Philmo, and I am the president of Schulich Ignite. My responsibilities include guiding the executive team to ensure our club runs smoothly and achieves its goals, which includes delivering quality coding workshops and experiences! I graduated with an MSc in Computer Science, and I am currently employed at Circle Cardiovascular Imaging as a R&D Software Developer. My passion for teaching has led me to teach again at Schulich Ignite. If there is a person among you who loves to watch Starcraft (both Brood War and SC2), then I will be touched. I'm also into drawing and 3D modeling.
