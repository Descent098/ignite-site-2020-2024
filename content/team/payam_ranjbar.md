Hello! I'm Payam, your friendly VP External of Schulich Ignite. My role here involves building bridges with the world beyond our club's network. From organizing events to facilitating stakeholder meetings, I'm here to ensure that our club connects with the wider community. 
I'm studying for a Master of Software Engineering at the University of Calgary, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction and Immersive Technologies in healthcare. Beyond academics, I'm a video game enthusiast, with a particular love for the art and craft of mixing storytelling and engineering. Perhaps one day you'll stumble upon my name in the credits of a big video game! Who knows :)
