Hi everyone! My name is Abhari and I’m the Jr. VP Communications at Schulich Ignite. I support and work alongside the VP Communication, Pooja, with several tasks such as external outreach, social media content, recruitment announcements and emails, and much more! 

I am currently on a 16-month internship at TC Energy and will be returning to complete my final year of Biomedical Engineering next fall. Fun fact: I’m also the SU Engineering Faculty Representative. Outside of school, I like to bake, play soccer and I’ve recently picked up golfing.
