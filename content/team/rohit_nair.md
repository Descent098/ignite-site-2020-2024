My name is Rohit Nair and I am the VP of Events at Schulich Ignite. I am responsible for coordinating many of the activities the club partakes in, including a variety of workshops and our end-of-session Gala. I am currently in my second year of Computer Science. On the side, I love playing soccer and staying social on campus.
