Hello! I’m Ishita Chandra, the VP Events at Schulich Ignite. My role involves curating captivating speakers for our events, collaborating on informative presentations with fellow clubs and organizing the semester-end gala. I’m currently pursuing my third year of Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. In my free time, I enjoy reading fiction, solving puzzles and painting!
