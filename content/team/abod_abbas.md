My name is Abod Abbas and I am the President at Schulich Ignite. I am responsible for managing and monitoring the club, alongside being a mentor. I am in my third year of Software Engineering with a minor in Biomedical Engineering. A fun fact about me is that I enjoy bike riding and I love meeting new people, so feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
