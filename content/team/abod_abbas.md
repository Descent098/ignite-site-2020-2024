My name is Abod Abbas and I am the President at Schulich Ignite. I am responsible for managing and monitoring the club, alongside being a mentor. I am in my third year of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with a minor in Computer Engineering. A fun fact about me is that I enjoy travelling, sports, and I love meeting new people, so feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
