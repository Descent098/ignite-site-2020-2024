Hi! My name is Livesh and I’m the VP Finance for Schulich Ignite. I’m so excited to be part of such an incredible team and organization! As VP Finance, my responsibilities include budget maintenance, advocating for funding, reaching out to sponsors and dealing with all things monetary related. I am currently in my second year of Accounting and Computer Science, with hopes to eventually specialize in computer game development. When I’m not on my computer, you can find me playing SpikeBall with my friends. A fun fact about me is that I was born in Mauritius, an island off the coast of Madagascar!
