Hello! I’m Rodrigo, the VP of Content Development, and I'm currently studying engineering. I’m passionate about sports, fantasy and sci-fi novels, chess, and especially programming. At Schulich Ignite I aim to do my best to provide students passionate about coding with the tools they need to succeed in this path and create the right environment for them to learn too!
