Hello! My name is Tony, and I am the VP Logistics of Schulich Ignite. I am responsible for maintaining Schulich Ignite memberships, registering Schulich Ignite workshop participants, along with managing forms, attendance, and feedback for workshop sessions. Iâ€™ve recently returned from my internship year, and I am now in my final year of Software Engineering (with a minor in Biomedical Engineering). My interests are brewing and drinking coffee, building LEGO, and learning about social and culinary history.
