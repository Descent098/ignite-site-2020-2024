Bonjour! Je mâ€™appelle Sujesh et j'Ã©tudie Ã  l'universitÃ© de Calgary. Well, I still need to practice. Hello I am Sujesh and I love money so that makes me VP of Finance. I am responsible for identifying potential sponsors collaborating with them to keep the club funded round the year. I take care of the budgeting, record keeping and supporting the VPs financially with all the club activities.
I am in the 3rd year of MSc in Software Engineering and before this I was working as a software engineer. I love to play video games, enjoy watching science fiction series/movies (I donâ€™t worry about the ratings ðŸ™‚). I like to squash, hike and explore different cuisines. I love technology and am always hungry to learn like a black hole.
