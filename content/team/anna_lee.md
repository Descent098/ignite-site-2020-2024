Hello! I’m Jannine and I’m the VP of Communications at Schulich Ignite.  I am responsible for managing the club’s media platforms, facilitating communication between mentors and mentees as well as conducting overall outreach initiatives to grow the club’s membership. I am currently in my third year of software engineering. In my free time, I like to read and crochet!
