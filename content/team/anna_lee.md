Hello! My name is Anna Lee and I am the VP Finance at Schulich Ignite. I am responsible for managing the club's finances, finding and working with stakeholders to support the club, and purchasing supplies needed for club operations and our sessions. I am currently in my second year of Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. In my free time, I like to crochet and bake!
