Last weekend, Schulich Ignite celebrated the end of our Winter 2021 sessions with a Gala Event!

The Gala Event celebrated the accomplishments of over 300 students who attended our workshops this semester. Students spent the last 8 weeks either learning to code for the first time in our beginner sessions, or developing their skills in our new advanced workshops. It was incredible to see all the skills that they learned come together to create some amazing projects that were showcased at the event.

We also hosted a panel discussion with a variety of speakers in the tech industry! Thank you to Hansel Qiu, Isaac Faubert, Paul Inzani, Michèle Kawa, Maxine Chan, Dr. Emily Marasco, and Dan Cyca for volunteering your time and sharing your unique experiences. Our students and mentors greatly value your insights.

We would also like to thank Dr. Mohammad Moshirpour for his continued support of the club and our mission.

Finally, thank you to all the mentors who volunteered time out of their hectic schedules to connect with younger students and make their experience in the program memorable. Schulich Ignite would not be what it is without you.

And that’s a wrap! The Schulich Ignite team is proud to say that our Winter 2021 sessions were a success! We hope to see you at our next one!
