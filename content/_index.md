Coding helps you develop many valuable skills!
* **Problem solving:**
  Programming teaches you how to efficiently break down complex tasks into smaller and more manageable operations.
* **Persistence:**
  Although itâ€™s super fun, coding can have its challenges sometimes! Every programmer faces obstacles in perfecting their code but overcoming these challenges gives you a keen eye for detail and builds your grit.
