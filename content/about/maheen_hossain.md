Hello! My name is Maheen Hossain and I am the VP Logistics at Schulich Ignite. I am currently in my third year of software engineering. I am responsible for everything related to logistics, which includes coordinating interviews for potential mentors, creating feedback forms to help the club grow, and organizing all mentees and mentors into their respective groups at the start of sessions. In my free time, I enjoy learning about computers.
