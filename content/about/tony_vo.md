Hello! My name is Tony Vo and I am the VP Finance for Schulich Ignite. I am in my third year of Software Engineering with a minor in Biomedical Engineering. In addition to being a mentor, I am responsible for managing the clubâ€™s finances, finding and working with stakeholders to support the club, and purchasing food and supplies for the club. Fun fact about me: outside of school, I love learning about history.
