## Our Mission
Schulich Ignite is a club at the University of Calgary with a mission to inspire the next generation of programmers and make learning to code fun and accessible for all students! We offer free introductory and advanced Python workshops to high school students across Canada through virtual and in-person sessions. All students are connected with mentors who are able to offer one-on-one support as well as insight in to their experience as students in technology themselves!

### Promoting Diversity in Tech
Although it is a fast growing industry, software engineering and computer science fields still struggle with a lack of diversity. In Canada, 20% of the tech workforce identify as women, 31.9% identify as a visible minority and only 1.2% identify as Indigenous.

Diversity is important to promote in all industries, but especially in tech since this field is based on innovation and aims to solve the worldâ€™s challenging problems. A diverse set of minds is necessary to look beyond conventional means to find unique and innovative solutions to these problems.

Schulich Ignite aims to connect with underrepresented groups in STEM to welcome them into this field and to invite them to explore their passion for technology. We aim to provide every student with the opportunity to learn to code and more importantly, we aim to provide students with the feeling that they always have a place in STEM. <br><br>

## Meet our Team
Schulich Ignite is a student-run organization led by passionate and motivated volunteers. Our team strongly believes in our mission and puts in hard work year-round to ensure high quality programs. The team consists of students currently pursuing undergraduate and graduate degrees in various programs including software engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and more. Many of our mentors also have industry experience and can offer valuable insight to students that are interested in pursuing tech-related careers.

Schulich Ignite would not be possible without the efforts of our highly dedicated mentors and executive team. We wish that our hard work helps inspire you and we hope to meet you at our next workshop!
