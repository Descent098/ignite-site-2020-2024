title: "Promoting Diversity in Tech"
---

Although it is a fast growing industry, software engineering and computer science fields still struggle with a lack of diversity. In Canada, 20% of the tech workforce identify as women, 31.9% identify as a visible minority and only 1.2% identify as Indigenous.

Diversity is important to promote in all industries, but especially in tech since this field is based on innovation and aims to solve the worldâ€™s challenging problems. A diverse set of minds is necessary to look beyond conventional means to find unique and innovative solutions to these problems.

Schulich Ignite aims to connect with underrepresented groups in STEM to welcome them into this field and to invite them to explore their passion for technology. We aim to provide every student with the opportunity to learn to code and more importantly, we aim to provide students with the feeling that they always have a place in STEM.
