question: "Are the sessions online, or in person?"
---

We will have two formats for our sessions this semester:

1. **Hybrid**: We will have the ENG G 203 room booked in the Schulich School of Engineering Building,on the University of Calgary Campus, for students that have access to this form of transport. However, we will also be hosting these sessions on a zoom for students out of reach. Nonetheless, we highly Encourage in person participation here.
2. **Online**: We will be running these sessions purely online on zoom, however that doesnâ€™t mean that it will be boring and long, we have engagement commissioners along with many interactive activities and exercises for you in this format too!!
