## What is ignite beginner?

Ignite Beginner is an 8 week course, split up into 1.5 hour sessions once a week. The aim of the course is to give people an easy to understand introduction to the [python programming language](https://www.python.org/). Python is one of the most popular programming languages largely because of how easy it is to get into. We have also refined our sessions over the years to make them as welcoming as possible, while providing all the important information!

## What will I learn?

The course will teach you not only the fundamentals of python, but the fundamentals of programming in general. You will be able to take the knowledge you learn and transfer it to all sorts of languages!

We also take a more visual approach to learning. No one likes just staring at text on a screen, so we try to make learning more interesting by teaching you the basics of game development while learning to code!

## Anything else I should know?

We also have an end of session gala where we have industry speakers come in and do presentations. We also give mentee's a chance to show off their projects (if they want to).
