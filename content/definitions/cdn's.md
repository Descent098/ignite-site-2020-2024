A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers strategically located around the world to efficiently deliver web content to users. The purpose of a CDN is to reduce the time it takes for a user to access content by caching it on servers that are closer to the user's location, thus reducing the distance and network hops between the user and the content.

When a user requests content from a website, the request is routed to the nearest CDN server that has a cached copy of the content. The CDN server then delivers the content to the user, typically resulting in faster load times and a better user experience. This process also helps reduce the load on the origin server by offloading some of the content delivery to the CDN.

CDNs can be used to deliver a variety of content types, including static files (such as images, videos, and documents) as well as dynamic content (such as web applications and APIs). CDNs typically use advanced caching techniques, such as edge caching and dynamic caching, to further optimize content delivery.

Overall, CDNs play an important role in improving website performance and user experience, particularly for websites with a global audience or high traffic volumes.
