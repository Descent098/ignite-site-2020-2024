All of the variables you have worked with at this point have been defined by someone else for you to use. They are simple concepts of storing information and telling the program how to interpret that information. What classes allow you to do is to create your own variables that work how you want them to. When you define a class, you give it a name that can be used to create an instance of it, and you define variables that are part of the class. Think of classes like a box filled with variables. This box can be accessed whenever you need, and it acts as its own large area in memory to store other things.
