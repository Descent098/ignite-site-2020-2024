At this point, you should have a good understanding of the basic variables in programming, as well as how to use loops and functions effectively. For the most part, that's all you need to make effective programs. Sometimes however, you may have difficulties when trying to create programs. Perhaps you need to make 10 versions of the same thing, where each version has multiple variables you need to keep track of. For example when looking at Super Mario, each individual block in the game has it's own specific coordinates, as well as information on if it holds a coin or not. Or maybe you just want to wrap several variables under one name to keep things less confusing. This is where classes come in.
