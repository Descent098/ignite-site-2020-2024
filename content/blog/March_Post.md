Schulich Ignite is now in our fourth week of sessions, marking the halfway point of our workshops this semester!

Our beginner sessions covered lists and loops this week while our advanced sessions talked about inheritance. All of our students are continuing to develop their tool sets for the next couple of weeks as they prepare to create their own projects. We canâ€™t wait to see what they come up with!

The team is always looking for ways to improve sessions, so we have recently added a segment to our workshops that showcases the interesting applications of programming in the tech industry today! Check out this story about DECODR that we presented this week!
