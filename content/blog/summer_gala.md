Schulich Ignite celebrated the end of our summer sessions with a Gala!

At the Gala, students had the chance to showcase the projects that they have been working on for the past two weeks to mentors and friends. It was amazing to see how students who started with little to no experience in programming are now able to create complex and unique projects!

We would like to extend our gratitude to Hansel Qiu and Dan Cyca who volunteered their time to be industry speakers for the event. Hansel and Dan gave thoughtful insight on what it means to be a programmer in industry and what their experiences are like working for Google and AMD.

We would also like to thank Dr. Mohammad Moshirpour for attending and speaking at the Gala as well as for supporting Schulich Ignite and our mission to inspire the next generation of programmers.

Finally, thank you to all the students, mentors and industry speakers for putting in the time and effort to make the Gala a success! The Ignite team is excited to continue inspiring students and providing them with opportunities to showcase their talents!
