We are excited for our collaboration with the Information Security Club which will be happening in the last week of November! Through this collaborative session, students will understand what information security is, how topics in information security relate to their day-to-day lives, and will understand how the technology that they use, particularly websites and passwords, can be vulnerable to attack. Students, keep your eyes open for an email regarding this collaboration!
